  fullText: "\u200ApH is measured on a scale from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is considered
    neutral. Any pH below 7 is acidic, while a pH reading above 7 is basic or alkaline.
    The difference between each pH unit is a tenfold value. For instance, a pH of
    8 is 10 times more basic than a pH of 7 and a pH of 4 is 100 times more acidic
    than a pH of 6.  The most accurate method to measure pH is with a pH meter and
    electrode. pH analysis should be completed as soon as possible after sample collection.
    We will now begin the pH sample analysis tutorial. To begin, click on the pH
    meter to turn it on. "
